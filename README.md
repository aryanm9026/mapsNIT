🌟 Why mapsNIT?
As students of MNIT Jaipur , we have a huge 300+ acres of college which feels impossible to explore as a first year newbie in the college , where to find the office of a specific professor , where are our labs , where is the seminar hall , etc. mapsNIT is your one stop solution for this.
You can search of any professor's office, building name, lab name (even acessible through your course code), nearest facilities like water cooler, washrooms, etc. and many more and the app gives you the exact location of it which you can navigate to easily. So no more running around the huge campus , just use our app and you are good to go. (No pun intended 👀)
